# Tabs Component

## Description

The Tabs Component is a React-based tabbed navigation menu that allows users to switch between different content sections. It was developed as part of a task to build a Tabs Component for an application, focusing on code quality, maintainability, reusability, and a clean API design.

## Features

- Renders a tabbed navigation menu and corresponding content sections for each tab.
- Allows users to switch between tabs by clicking on the tab headers.
- Supports dynamic content for each tab, enabling changes in content based on user interaction.
- Implemented using the compound component pattern, providing a modular and reusable structure.
- Provides a clean and intuitive API for defining tabs and their content.
- Supports customization of tab styling and behavior, including active tab highlighting.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd tabs-component
```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the Tabs Component in action.

## Components

### TabsNavigator

The `TabsNavigator` component is the main component that encapsulates the tabbed navigation functionality. It uses the `Tab` and `TabPanel` components as children to define the tabs and their respective content.

### Tab

The `Tab` component represents an individual tab in the navigation menu. It accepts the following props:

- `active` (optional): A boolean value indicating if the tab is currently active.
- `onClick` (optional): A function to be called when the tab is clicked.
- `children`: The content of the tab, typically a text label.

### TabPanel

The `TabPanel` component represents the content section corresponding to an individual tab. It accepts the following prop:

- `children`: The content of the tab panel.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the Tabs Component by modifying the `style.css` file. The CSS classes defined in this file allow you to adjust the tab header styles, active tab highlighting, and other visual aspects of the component.

## Dependencies

- React: ^16.0.0 or later
- axios: ^0.21.1 or later (for fetching data)
- next: ^11.0.0 or later (for server-side rendering and routing)
- react-dom: ^16.0.0 or later

## Evaluation Criteria

The implementation of the Tabs Component was evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Code structure and organization.
- Effective use of the compound component pattern.
- Adherence to React best practices and component architecture.
- Component API design and usability.
- Customization options and flexibility.
- Code efficiency and performance.
- Documentation and instructions.
